To do:
 
Done:
 - add snubber capacitors, see effect?
 - try to simulate an alternating current load
 - try to model what happens when the power is cut OFF (unable to do)
 - try without the capacitance multiplier (~40 dB worse)
 - pick one alternate N-MOSFET to try
 - pick out a proper gate protection diode for the N-MOSFET
 - add multiples of decoupling caps for lower ESR
 - add 0-Ohm resistors for build convenience
 - confirm if the AC input is meant to be 9V RMS or 9V Pk-Pk
 - find a model for a negative regulator (LT1175, LT3015)

Top-Level Requirements of the Power Supply:

0.0) voltage ripple 4 uV (taken from TPS7A47 datasheet)
0.1) voltage DC +3.3V, +5.0V, +12.0V, -12.0V
0.2) current DC 500mA
0.3) passively cooled (i.e. no forced-air)
0.4) sustainably sourceable (no short lifecycle or boutique parts)

Assumptions:

- single sided PCA configuration
- don't have to worry about getting AC mains voltage
- don't have to worry about the connection/interface to the load
- use TPS7A47 series regulators
- connects strictly to AC mains (60Hz, 120V RMS, single phase)
- AC mains will be switched on/off arbitrarily
- max specified load won't be exceeded
- don't have to worry about surges (i.e. AC mains fluctuations)
- don't have to worry about abnormal environmental conditions (humidity, temperature)
- operate at room temperature indoors

Nice-to-have:

- long life (>5000 Hrs)
- less than 25cm^2
- less than $50
- all surface mount

Requirements for the ripple pre-attenuation section

1.0) ripple is sufficiently low not to impede (0.0):
 - PSRR (dB) = 20log10(Vin/Vout).  
 - PSRR @ 60 Hz = 80 dB 
 Therefore:
 - Vout = 4*10^(-6) V
 - Therefore, Vin = 40 mV (largest allowable ripple)
 - Similarly, Vin = 4 mV (gives 1 decade margin)

1.1) DC level is sufficiently high:
 - datasheet for TPS7A47 to have 1V dropout for -80dB PSRR performance
 - datasheet for TPS7A47 to minimum 307mV for sufficient DC output level
 - don't want extra dropout (i.e. > 1V) otherwise wasted energy as heat
 - Iout = 500mA needs to be sustained

1.2.1) Vce of the pass transistor is sufficient
 - as a reference (illustrative example):
 - datasheet for MJD112/MJD117 STM charateristic curves and plots show:
 		- saturation voltage 25 deg C is steady (flat) with Vce = 0.85V
 		- saturation collector current over this range is 0.01A to 1.00A
 - we care about 0-500mA Ic, so give 50% margin on top of Vce
 - therefore minimum (at all times) is Vce = 1.5 x 0.85 V = 1.275 V
 - to be extra safe Vce should be Vce = 2.0 X 0.85 V = 1.70 V
 - NOTE: restricting the base-current helps a stay out of saturation
 - NOTE: restricting the base-current means more Vce drop and dissipare more power
 - NOTE: the resistor connected to the base also affects the corner frequency
 - NOTE: the transistor needs enough gain so that its RC filter current remains small even when under large load (i.e. large power)

 1.2.2) Vgs of the pass MOSET is sufficiently low 
 - example: Vgs = 2.5V means you'll also have an average drop of 2.5V across the drain-to-source connection (Vds)
 - If Vgs is low, you dissipate less average power in the MOSFET
 - If Vgs is low, the source voltage will be a bit higher, so there is more headroom left for the dropout of the regulator.
 - "low" Vgs can be obtained (but it is special), around 1-2V
 - "high" Vgs is more common, is usually 2-4V, but can be more
 - NOTE: Transconductance, gfs, is a measure of the sensitivity of drain current to changes in gate-source bias.  MOSFET transconductance is sort of akin to BJT Hfe or Beta.  
 - Rds(on) can be in the 100s of mOhms, but modern devices can be much lower (in some cases, less than 10 mOhms, even for high power transistors)


Come up with some test cases (do these for 5V, +12V, -12V)

A) max current:
- Iout = 5mA

- Vin (DC) = 
- Vin (AC) = 
- Vce = 
- Vout (DC) = 
- Vout (AC) = 


B) medium current:
- Iout = 50mA

- Vin (DC) = 
- Vin (AC) = 
- Vce = 
- Vout (DC) = 
- Vout (AC) = 

C) low current:
- Iout = 500mA

- Vin (DC) = 
- Vin (AC) = 
- Vce = 
- Vout (DC) = 
- Vout (AC) =
